When we read param.json file in lookup at that time we need to make sure that in setting we need to uncheck ## "First row only".

When we get error while loading like to many columns then we can go to settings of for each and there we can select fault tolerence and select ## "Skip imcomplatible rows". This column & rows data we can get in different folder to see which all were rejected.
